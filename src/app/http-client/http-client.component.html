<p>
  This is a simple HTTP client that let' you easily send requests that already ship with your <code>access_token</code>.
  Note that the HTTP server in question must explicitly accept requests originated from <code>{{this.router.url}}</code>
  or must accept requests from anywhere (not advised).

<div class="http-server">
  <input type="text">
</div>

<div class="http-response">
  {{this.httpResponse}}
</div>
